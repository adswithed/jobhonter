# GitHub Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up the JobHonter repository on GitHub with our open source + SaaS hybrid model.

## 🎯 Repository Strategy

We use a **single public repository** with smart feature flagging to separate open source and SaaS features.

### Repository Structure
- **Public Repository**: Contains all open source code
- **Private SaaS Features**: Handled via feature flags and private packages
- **Same UI**: Both versions use identical interface

## 🚀 GitHub Repository Setup

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/new)
2. Create repository: `jobhonter`
3. Choose: **Public**
4. Description: "AI-powered job application automation platform - Open Source"
5. **Don't** initialize with README (we already have one)

### 2. Add Remote and Push

```bash
# Add GitHub remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/jobhonter.git

# Push initial commit
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Repository Settings

#### Branch Protection
```bash
# Go to Settings > Branches > Add rule
Branch name pattern: main
✅ Require pull request reviews before merging
✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
✅ Include administrators
```

#### Topics (for discoverability)
Add these topics to your repository:
```
job-automation, ai-applications, email-automation, 
typescript, nextjs, expressjs, prisma, open-source,
job-search, career-tools, nodejs, monorepo
```

## 🔐 SaaS Features Management

### Environment Variables for Different Modes

#### Open Source Mode (Default)
```env
# No special environment variables needed
# Features automatically detected as open source
```

#### SaaS Development Mode
```env
SAAS_MODE=true
JOBHONTER_EDITION=saas-pro
# Private API keys for AI features
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key
```

### Private Package Management

1. **Create Private npm Organization**
   ```bash
   npm adduser
   npm org create @jobhonter-saas
   ```

2. **Publish Private Packages**
   ```bash
   # For SaaS-only features
   cd packages/ai-agent
   npm publish --access restricted
   ```

3. **Install in SaaS Environment**
   ```bash
   npm install @jobhonter-saas/ai-agent
   ```

## 📋 Repository Labels

Create these labels for issue management:

### Type Labels
- `feature` - New feature request
- `bug` - Something isn't working  
- `docs` - Documentation improvements
- `enhancement` - Improve existing feature
- `question` - Further information requested

### Priority Labels
- `priority: high` - Critical issues
- `priority: medium` - Important but not urgent
- `priority: low` - Nice to have

### Good First Issues
- `good first issue` - Good for newcomers
- `help wanted` - Extra attention needed

### SaaS vs Open Source
- `open-source` - Open source specific
- `saas-feature` - SaaS premium feature (for internal use)

## 🔧 GitHub Actions Setup

Our CI/CD pipeline is already configured in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

- **✅ Linting** - ESLint and Prettier
- **✅ Type Checking** - TypeScript compilation
- **✅ Testing** - Jest unit tests  
- **✅ Build** - Production builds
- **✅ Security** - Dependency scanning

### Secrets Configuration

Add these secrets in GitHub Settings > Secrets:

```bash
# For deployment
VERCEL_TOKEN=your-vercel-token
RAILWAY_TOKEN=your-railway-token

# For SaaS features (if needed in CI)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
DATABASE_URL=your-test-database-url
```
