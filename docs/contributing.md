## üîß Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use **strict TypeScript** - no `any` types
- Prefer **interfaces** over types for object definitions
- Use **proper generics** for reusable functions
- Document complex types with JSDoc comments

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  createdAt: Date;
}

// ‚ùå Avoid
const user: any = { /* ... */ };
```

### Code Style

- **2 spaces** for indentation
- **Semicolons** required
- **Single quotes** for strings
- **Trailing commas** in objects and arrays

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
const config = {
  apiUrl: 'https://api.example.com',
  timeout: 5000,
};

// ‚ùå Avoid
const config = {
  apiUrl: "https://api.example.com",
  timeout: 5000
}
```

### File Organization

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/          # Reusable UI components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/              # Next.js pages
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/              # Custom React hooks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/              # Utility functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/              # TypeScript type definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ constants/          # Application constants
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ __tests__/          # Test files
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: `kebab-case.ts`
- **Components**: `PascalCase.tsx`
- **Functions**: `camelCase`
- **Constants**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- **Types/Interfaces**: `PascalCase`

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Group related tests with `describe` blocks

```typescript
// Example test structure
describe('Email Discovery Service', () => {
  describe('extractEmailsFromText', () => {
    it('should extract valid email addresses', () => {
      const text = 'Contact us at hiring@company.com';
      const emails = extractEmailsFromText(text);
      expect(emails).toContain('hiring@company.com');
    });

    it('should ignore invalid email formats', () => {
      const text = 'Not an email: invalid@';
      const emails = extractEmailsFromText(text);
      expect(emails).toHaveLength(0);
    });
  });
});
```

## üìù Documentation

### API Documentation

- Use JSDoc comments for all public functions
- Include parameter types and return types
- Provide usage examples

```typescript
/**
 * Extracts email addresses from job posting text
 * @param text - The text content to search
 * @param options - Configuration options
 * @returns Array of unique email addresses found
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const emails = extractEmails("Contact hiring@company.com");
 * console.log(emails); // ["hiring@company.com"]
 * ```
 */
export function extractEmails(
  text: string,
  options?: ExtractOptions
): string[] {
  // Implementation...
}
```
