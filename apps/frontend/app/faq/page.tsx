              <AccordionContent>
                JobHonter uses AI to scan multiple platforms (Twitter, Reddit, LinkedIn, and Google) for job
                opportunities that match your profile. It then extracts contact information, crafts personalized
                applications, and sends them directly to hiring managers on your behalf. You can control how many
                applications are sent per day and review all communications before they're sent.

              <AccordionContent>
                JobHonter offers a free trial that allows you to send up to 5 applications. After that, we offer two
                paid plans: Basic ($19/month) which includes up to 20 applications per month, and Pro ($39/month) which
                includes unlimited applications and additional features like resume optimization and priority support.

              <AccordionTrigger>How does JobHonter find job opportunities?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                Our AI agent continuously monitors multiple platforms for job postings, hiring announcements, and
                recruitment messages. It uses natural language processing to understand job requirements and match them
                with your skills and preferences. This allows us to find opportunities that might not be posted on
                traditional job boards.

              <AccordionTrigger>Can I review applications before they're sent?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                Yes! By default, JobHonter will show you each application before it's sent, allowing you to approve,
                edit, or reject it. You can also enable an auto-send feature for opportunities that meet certain
                criteria if you prefer a more hands-off approach.

              <AccordionContent>
                Very personalized. Our AI analyzes the job description and your resume to highlight the most relevant
                skills and experiences. It also researches the company to include specific details about why you're
                interested in working there. You can review and customize the email templates used for different types
                of applications.
