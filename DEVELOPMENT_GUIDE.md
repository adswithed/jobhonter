# JobHonter - Development Guide

## Guiding Principles

### Core Development Principle: "Security-First, Modular Excellence"

**Primary Rule**: Every line of code must pass the **"Production Security Review"** - ask yourself: "Is this the most secure, efficient, and maintainable approach possible?" If the answer is no, refactor until it is.

### The Four Pillars of JobHonter Development

#### 1. **Zero-Trust Security** 🔒
- **Principle**: Assume every input is malicious, every connection is compromised
- **Action**: Validate everything, sanitize all inputs, encrypt all data
- **Reminder**: "Security isn't an afterthought - it's the foundation"

#### 2. **Modular Architecture** 🏗️
- **Principle**: Each component should be independent, testable, and replaceable
- **Action**: Design for pluggability, clear interfaces, minimal coupling
- **Reminder**: "If you can't test it in isolation, you need to refactor it"

#### 3. **Open-Source First** 🌐
- **Principle**: Separate open-source from private features cleanly
- **Action**: Build core functionality openly, enhance with private AI features
- **Reminder**: "The community should benefit from our core innovations"

#### 4. **Automated Excellence** 🤖
- **Principle**: Automation should feel magical to users, robust to developers
- **Action**: Handle failures gracefully, provide clear feedback, maintain reliability
- **Reminder**: "Users should never know something went wrong - but we should always know"

## Recommended Task Execution Order

### Phase 1: Foundation First (Weeks 1-4)
**Goal**: Create unbreakable foundation for all future development

#### **IMMEDIATE START: Task 1.1 - Project Setup & Architecture**
**Why First**: Zero dependencies, enables all other work
**Time**: 3 days
**Success Criteria**: 
- Clean monorepo structure ✅
- All packages initialized ✅
- TypeScript configured globally ✅
- Development workflow established ✅

#### **Next: Task 1.2 - Core Packages Foundation**
**Why Second**: All other packages depend on shared types and utilities
**Time**: 2 days
**Dependencies**: 1.1 completed
**Success Criteria**:
- Shared TypeScript interfaces defined ✅
- Common utilities available to all packages ✅
- Validation schemas implemented ✅

#### **Then: Task 1.3 - Database & Authentication Backend**
**Why Third**: Security foundation for entire platform
**Time**: 4 days
**Dependencies**: 1.1, 1.2 completed
**Critical Security Focus**:
- JWT implementation with refresh tokens
- Password hashing (bcrypt/argon2)
- Rate limiting implementation
- Input validation middleware

#### **Parallel Track: Task 1.4 - Basic Frontend Setup**
**Why Parallel**: Can develop while backend is being built
**Time**: 3 days (start after 1.3 day 2)
**Dependencies**: 1.3 partially completed
**Focus**: Authentication flow integration

#### **Finally: Task 1.5 - CI/CD Pipeline**
**Why Last in Phase**: Needs complete codebase structure
**Time**: 2 days
**Dependencies**: 1.1 completed
**Note**: Can be done in parallel with other tasks

### Phase 2: Job Discovery Engine (Weeks 5-8)
**Goal**: Build the core job discovery capability

#### **Start: Task 2.1 - Scraper Infrastructure**
**Why First**: Foundation for all scraping activities
**Time**: 5 days
**Critical Focus**:
- Rate limiting to avoid detection
- Proxy rotation for scale
- Error handling and retry logic
- Pluggable architecture for extensibility

#### **Parallel Development: Tasks 2.2, 2.3, 2.4**
**Why Parallel**: Independent implementations once infrastructure exists
**Total Time**: 4 days each (can overlap)
**Execution Strategy**:
- Start with Twitter scraper (2.2) - highest volume
- Begin Reddit scraper (2.3) on day 2
- Start Google Jobs (2.4) on day 3
- All should complete around the same time

#### **Finish: Task 2.5 - Job Discovery Orchestration**
**Why Last**: Needs all scrapers completed
**Time**: 3 days
**Critical Focus**:
- Deduplication algorithms
- Job relevance scoring
- Parallel coordination

### Phase 3: Contact Discovery & Email System (Weeks 9-12)
**Goal**: Build intelligent contact discovery and reliable email infrastructure

#### **Start: Task 3.1 - Email Discovery Engine**
**Why First**: Core capability needed for all contact finding
**Time**: 4 days
**Dependencies**: 2.5 completed
**Focus**: Regex patterns, validation, fallback methods

#### **Next: Task 3.2 - Smart Link Following**
**Why Second**: Enhances email discovery capabilities
**Time**: 4 days
**Dependencies**: 3.1 completed
**Technical Challenge**: JavaScript rendering for SPAs

#### **Parallel Start: Task 3.3 - Email Sending Infrastructure**
**Why Parallel**: Independent of contact discovery
**Time**: 4 days (start on day 3 of phase)
**Dependencies**: 1.2 completed
**Critical Focus**:
- Multi-provider failover
- Queue management
- Deliverability optimization

#### **Sequential: Tasks 3.4 & 3.5**
**Execution Order**: 3.4 then 3.5
**Why Sequential**: 3.5 needs 3.4's application generation
**Time**: 5 days + 3 days
**Focus**: Template system and tracking integration

### Phase 4: Frontend Dashboard (Weeks 13-16)
**Goal**: Create intuitive user experience

#### **Parallel Development Strategy**
**Why Parallel**: Frontend components are largely independent
**Execution Plan**:
- Tasks 4.1 & 4.2 start simultaneously (both need backend APIs)
- Task 4.4 can start early (only needs basic auth)
- Task 4.3 starts after 4.2 (needs tracking data)
- Task 4.5 is final polish (needs all UI components)

#### **Recommended Order**:
1. **4.4 (User Profile)** - Start day 1, foundational
2. **4.1 & 4.2 (Dashboards)** - Start day 2, parallel development
3. **4.3 (Analytics)** - Start day 6, needs data from 4.2
4. **4.5 (Mobile/PWA)** - Start day 10, final polish

### Phase 5: AI Enhancement (Weeks 17-20)
**Goal**: Add intelligent automation features

#### **Critical Path**: 5.1 → 5.2 → 5.3 → 5.4
**Why Sequential**: Each builds on the previous
**Note**: 5.4 (ML Pipeline) can be pushed to later if needed

#### **Task 5.1 - AI Application Generation (PRIVATE)**
**Priority**: Highest - this is the core differentiator
**Time**: 6 days
**Security Note**: Keep all AI logic in private package
**Focus**: GPT-4/Claude integration, prompt engineering

### Phase 6: SaaS Features (Weeks 21-24)
**Goal**: Enable monetization and enterprise features

#### **Sequential Order**: 6.1 → 6.2 → 6.3 → 6.4
**Why Sequential**: Each depends on the previous
**Critical**: Start with billing (6.1) as everything else depends on it

### Phase 7: Production Ready (Weeks 25-28)
**Goal**: Secure, tested, deployed system

#### **Parallel Execution Possible**:
- 7.1 (Security) - Can start early and run throughout
- 7.2 (Performance) - After core features complete
- 7.3 (Testing) - Parallel with security and performance
- 7.4 (Documentation) - Can start early
- 7.5 (Deployment) - Final task, needs all others
